# GenerativeAIExamples
Generative AI (GenAI) Examples is a collection of GenAI examples such as ChatQnA, Copilot, which heavily reused ecosystem-based components plus Intel optimizations.

# ChatQnA
[ChatQnA](./ChatQnA/README.md) is a chatbot for question and answering through retrieval argumented generation (RAG). The example is developed with Langchain API and Redis as vector store, and deployed on Gaudi with Xeon through Hugging Face text generation inference (TGI) serving.

# CodeGen
[CodeGen](./CodeGen/README.md) is a copilot application designed for code generation use case. We offer a VS Code plugin for easy usage. In this example, we demonstrate how code generation can be efficiently executed on the Intel Gaudi2 platform.


# DocSum
[DocSum](./DocSum/README.md) is a chatbot for summarizing the content of your documents or reports. The example is developed with Langchain API and deployed on Gaudi through Hugging Face text generation inference (TGI) serving.

# VisualQnA
[VisualQnA](./VisualQnA/README.md) is a chatbot for visual question and answering task. This example guides you through how to deploy a [LLaVA](https://llava-vl.github.io/) (Large Language and Vision Assistant) model on Intel Gaudi2.
