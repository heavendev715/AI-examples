# Build Mega Service of ChatQnA on Xeon

This document outlines the deployment process for a ChatQnA application utilizing the [GenAIComps](https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIComps.git) microservice pipeline on Intel Xeon server. The steps include Docker image creation, container deployment via Docker Compose, and service execution to integrate microservices such as `embedding`, `retriever`, `rerank`, and `llm`. We will publish the Docker images to Docker Hub soon, it will simplify the deployment process for this service.

## ðŸš€ Apply Xeon Server on AWS

To apply a Xeon server on AWS, start by creating an AWS account if you don't have one already. Then, head to the [EC2 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home) to begin the process. Within the EC2 service, select the Amazon EC2 M7i or M7i-flex instance type to leverage the power of 4th Generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors. These instances are optimized for high-performance computing and demanding workloads.

For detailed information about these instance types, you can refer to this [link](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m7i/). Once you've chosen the appropriate instance type, proceed with configuring your instance settings, including network configurations, security groups, and storage options.

After launching your instance, you can connect to it using SSH (for Linux instances) or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) (for Windows instances). From there, you'll have full access to your Xeon server, allowing you to install, configure, and manage your applications as needed.

## ðŸš€ Build Docker Images

First of all, you need to build Docker Images locally and install the python package of it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIComps.git
cd GenAIComps
```

### 1. Build Embedding Image

```bash
docker build -t opea/gen-ai-comps:embedding-tei-server --build-arg https_proxy=$https_proxy --build-arg http_proxy=$http_proxy -f comps/embeddings/langchain/docker/Dockerfile .
```

### 2. Build Retriever Image

```bash
docker build -t opea/gen-ai-comps:retriever-redis-server --build-arg https_proxy=$https_proxy --build-arg http_proxy=$http_proxy -f comps/retrievers/langchain/docker/Dockerfile .
```

### 3. Build Rerank Image

```bash
docker build -t opea/gen-ai-comps:reranking-tei-xeon-server --build-arg https_proxy=$https_proxy --build-arg http_proxy=$http_proxy -f comps/reranks/langchain/docker/Dockerfile .
```

### 4. Build LLM Image

```bash
docker build -t opea/gen-ai-comps:llm-tgi-server --build-arg https_proxy=$https_proxy --build-arg http_proxy=$http_proxy -f comps/llms/langchain/docker/Dockerfile .
```

Then run the command `docker images`, you will have the following four Docker Images:

1. `opea/gen-ai-comps:embedding-tei-server`
2. `opea/gen-ai-comps:retriever-redis-server`
3. `opea/gen-ai-comps:reranking-tei-xeon-server`
4. `opea/gen-ai-comps:llm-tgi-server`

## ðŸš€ Start Microservices

### Setup Environment Variables

Since the `docker_compose.yaml` will consume some environment variables, you need to setup them in advance as below.

```bash
export http_proxy=${your_http_proxy}
export https_proxy=${your_http_proxy}
export EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID="BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5"
export RERANK_MODEL_ID="BAAI/bge-reranker-large"
export LLM_MODEL_ID="Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3"
export TEI_EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT="http://${host_ip}:6006"
export TEI_RERANKING_ENDPOINT="http://${host_ip}:8808"
export TGI_LLM_ENDPOINT="http://${host_ip}:9009"
export REDIS_URL="redis://${host_ip}:6379"
export INDEX_NAME="rag-redis"
export HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=${your_hf_api_token}
```

Note: Please replace with `host_ip` with you external IP address, do not use localhost.

### Start Microservice Docker Containers

```bash
docker compose -f docker_compose.yaml up -d
```

### Validate Microservices

1. TEI Embedding Service

```bash
curl ${host_ip}:6006/embed \
    -X POST \
    -d '{"inputs":"What is Deep Learning?"}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

2. Embedding Microservice

```bash
curl http://${host_ip}:6000/v1/embeddings\
  -X POST \
  -d '{"text":"hello"}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

3. Retriever Microservice  
   To validate the retriever microservice, you need to generate a mock embedding vector of length 768 in Python script:

```Python
import random
embedding = [random.uniform(-1, 1) for _ in range(768)]
print(embedding)
```

Then substitute your mock embedding vector for the `${your_embedding}` in the following cURL command:

```bash
curl http://${host_ip}:7000/v1/retrieval\
  -X POST \
  -d '{"text":"What is the revenue of Nike in 2023?","embedding":${your_embedding}}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

4. TEI Reranking Service

```bash
curl http://${host_ip}:8808/rerank \
    -X POST \
    -d '{"query":"What is Deep Learning?", "texts": ["Deep Learning is not...", "Deep learning is..."]}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

5. Reranking Microservice

```bash
curl http://${host_ip}:8000/v1/reranking\
  -X POST \
  -d '{"initial_query":"What is Deep Learning?", "retrieved_docs": [{"text":"Deep Learning is not..."}, {"text":"Deep learning is..."}]}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

6. TGI Service

```bash
curl http://${host_ip}:9009/generate \
  -X POST \
  -d '{"inputs":"What is Deep Learning?","parameters":{"max_new_tokens":17, "do_sample": true}}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

7. LLM Microservice

```bash
curl http://${host_ip}:9000/v1/chat/completions\
  -X POST \
  -d '{"query":"What is Deep Learning?","max_new_tokens":17,"top_k":10,"top_p":0.95,"typical_p":0.95,"temperature":0.01,"repetition_penalty":1.03,"streaming":true}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

Following the validation of all aforementioned microservices, we are now prepared to construct a mega-service.

## ðŸš€ Construct Mega Service

To construct the Mega Service, we utilize the [GenAIComps](https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIComps.git) microservice pipeline within the `chatqna.py` Python script. Upon executing the script, each microservice's intermediate results will be displayed, allowing users to verify the accuracy of the outcomes and make targeted modifications if necessary.

To launch the Mega Service, simply run the following command:

### Run Mega Service with Python

```bash
# install packages
cd /GenAIComps
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
# run chatqna service
cd /GenAIExamples/ChatQnA/microservice/xeon
python chatqna.py
```

### Run Mega Service with Docker

To run ChatQnA service with Docker, remember to pass the `${micro_service_host_ip}` variable into docker container, which is the real host ip of your microservices.

```bash
docker build -t opea/gen-ai-comps:chatqna-xeon-server --build-arg https_proxy=$https_proxy --build-arg http_proxy=$http_proxy -f docker/Dockerfile .
docker run -d --name="chatqna-xeon-server" -p 8888:8888 --ipc=host -e https_proxy=$https_proxy -e http_proxy=$http_proxy -e SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST_IP=${micro_service_host_ip} opea/gen-ai-comps:chatqna-xeon-server
```

Then you can check the result of your chatqna service with the command below.

```bash
docker logs chatqna-xeon-server
```

## ðŸš€ Access the Mega Service

Once the mega service docker is launched, a FastAPI server will be initiated. Users can interact with the service through the `/v1/chatqna` endpoint. Here's an example using `curl`:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8888/v1/chatqna -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
     "model": "Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3",
     "messages": "What is the revenue of Nike in 2023?"
     }
```
